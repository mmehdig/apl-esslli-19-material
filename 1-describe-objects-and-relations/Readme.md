# Descibe Objects and Relations in Image

Generating image descriptions has several difficault sub tasks
including recognition of objects and their relations, and 
grounding words in their relevant features.

The goal of this tutorial is to examine difficulties with        
generating descriptions	for objects and	their relations in images.

In this task you work with an online demo that generates image descriptions and 
also reports how each word in connected to feature representations.

You need to specify an image and two objects in the image, 
then system tries to generate word sequences referring to the objects and their relations.

This system is using a convolutional neural networks for image understanding and
a recurrent neural language model to generate descriptions.
