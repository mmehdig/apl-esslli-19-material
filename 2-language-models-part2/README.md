In this tutorial, we are going to use Convolutional Neural Networks for image description.

The main notebook file is [encoder-decoder_image_description.ipynb](encoder-decoder_image_description.ipynb).

You can run the tutorial in Google Colab:
https://colab.research.google.com/github/mmehdig/apl-esslli-19-material/blob/master/2-language-models-part2/encoder-decoder_image_description.ipynb

(optional) Additionally, you can take a look at how the simple captioning model is trained and defined [train_flickr30k_captions.ipynb](train_flickr30k_captions.ipynb).
In order, to train a new model on Flickr 30K dataset you need to download and process images separately.
